- Is dereferencing conversion?
  * The way things are working right now, it is for numbers
  * Does that mean that we should do the same for structs/unions/enums and just do away with derefAndConvert()?
- Properly understand the WASM memory model (!!!)
  * Memory layout may not always be straight-forward
  * buffer2js probably doesn't work right
  * Current memory access patterns are wrong https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API
- Rewrite c2js/js2c
  * We want **NAMED** functions
  * Why? No other way to deal with recursion
  * Simple solution:
    - Don't change anything major
    - c2js caches results in the env.jsBuffer
    - c2js returns the function name, rather than the function body
  * Do we still need to detect recursion?
    - I think so (but maybe not)
    - Easy way:
       * Keep a stack of visited types
       * If current type in stack, recursion found
